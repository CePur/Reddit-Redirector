# Reddit Redirector to Old New UI

This Tampermonkey script redirects reddit users to the (old) new Reddit UI using a workaround.
(as long as the workaround is available)

## How to use

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) extension for your browser.
2. Create a new script in Tampermonkey and copy the contents of `redditRedirector.js` into it.
3. Save the script and ensure it is enabled.

> **Note:** Chromium users may have to enable Developer Mode.

## Why not a gist?

The script may require updates over time
